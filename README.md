# exercise-timer
An Interval-based exercise timer using Vuejs.

## Why Vue?
  <p>This is my first application that I used with a javascript front-end framework. And from what I know, Vue is the most beginner-friendly out of the 3 (React, AngularJS).</p>

## Problems I had to solve

### 1. How do Store the state of my Application? <br>
  <p>At first I thought it would be a good idea to store my application's state in each components, but this was not easy since many of the other components required state from other components. So to achieve my needs I used Vuex. </p>
